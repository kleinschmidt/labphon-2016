# Abstract

Inferring prior beliefs. Start from SVALP abstract. Points to make are:
* (this all stems from problem of talker variability in speech perception)
    * TO understand speech perception, need to understand how cope with talker variation
    * To understand that, need to have some sense of what _prior beliefs_ people bring to adapting to new talker
* Role of prior beliefs
    * Accelerate adaptation to talkers that more or less match (probabilistic) expectations.
    * Prediction: comes at the cost of slower or incomplete adaptation to talkers that are outside the expected range.
* Measuring prior beliefs
    * There are currently no good ways to measure listeners prior beliefs
        * Can guess based on the distributions over actual talkers' accents
        * But laborious and expensive
        * More importantly, expectations not necessarily veridical reflection of the empirical distributions in the world [@Feldman2013]

## Conclusion framing

Possible alternative: 

Listeners _do_ use prior experience with groups to shape perception.

One hand, basic speech perception problem (lack of invariance). On the other hand, sociolinguistic variation. Bring these together: variation that's _predictable_ based on prior experience is actually _helpful_ because it accelerate adaptation to similar talkers in the future. This work provides a methodological tool to _probe_ listeners beliefs about different social variables.

We've demonstrated this at the level of the language as a whole, but this method can be just as well applied to investigate listeners' beliefs about the accents of more specific social variables (like gender, region, class, age, etc.).  This provides a potential bridge between
